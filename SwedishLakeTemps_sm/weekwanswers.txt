		DB: Good.
	
	  (b)Find: ^$ Replace: NaN Yes. The file still contains beginning and end of line characters.
	  
	  	DB: This will look for empty lines, right? What about just empty fields of data (e.g., \t\t).
	  
	  (c)Find: \s$ Replace: Nothing.
	  
	  	DB: Good, but you might add a + in case there are multiple spaces or tabs at the end of a line.
	  
	  (d)Find: space Replace: _
	  
	  	DB: Looks good.
	  
	  (e)Find: ^[^\w]$ Replace: Nothing
	  
	  	DB: I like this! The only complication is that if you've already inserted NaNs into the file, this wouldn't work.
	  
	  (f)Find: (\d+\.)(\d{1})\d+ Replace: $1$2
	  
	  	DB: Good. A slightly more compact version is (\d+\.\d)\d+ --> $1.
